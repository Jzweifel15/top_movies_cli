HELLO WORLD!

# TopMoviesCli

This gem is the first portfolio project for Flatiron Schools Online Software Engineering program that allows students to progress to the next module of the cohort.

The Top Movies CLI program will scrape data from the Rotten Tomatoes webpage on the top grossing movies of all time. A list of mvoies will be displayed in the command line for the user to choose from and get more information on each movie of choice.

## Usage

So far, I have only set up a small rough draft of how the program will be set up. The code seen so far is not the final product. 25:16

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_movies_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_movies_cli

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
